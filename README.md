📊 **Sales Insights Dashboard – Project Overview**

This project presents a Sales Insights Dashboard built in Excel using pivot tables, slicers, and automated KPIs. It provides a month-by-month view of business performance across service categories, customer geographies, and operational status metrics. The goal of the analysis is to help stakeholders understand what drives revenue, when demand peaks, and which services contribute most consistently throughout the year.

📁 **Dataset Summary**

This project uses two connected sheets—Sales and Customers.
The Sales sheet captures order-level transactions, including revenue, profit, service category, dates, and order status.
The Customers sheet provides customer information such as location, contact details, and linked order records.

Together, they offer a complete view of customer behaviour, service performance, and financial outcomes, enabling analysis of trends, demand, and profitability.

📈 **Insights Summary**

1. Across the months reviewed, the business maintains strong revenue and profit consistency, even during periods where order volumes fluctuate.
2. Mentoring Programs and LinkedIn Profile services consistently emerge as your highest-performing offerings, driving a large share of total sales.
3. Seasonal peaks in November–December indicate campaign-driven or year-end demand, whereas quieter months show organic baseline activity.
4. Low cancellation rates and a high proportion of delivered orders reflect strong fulfilment performance.

✔️ **Recommendations (Business-Focused)**

1. Expand top-performing services (Mentoring, LinkedIn) through premium bundles and targeted promotions.

2. Revamp lower-volume services by bundling, clearer value messaging, or repositioning.

3. Prepare for seasonal spikes with planned campaigns and capacity allocation.

4. Stabilise monthly demand using structured promotions, referral bonuses, or subscription-style offerings.

5. Investigate geographic opportunities by analysing state-level differences in conversion and demand.
